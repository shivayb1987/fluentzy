    "About": [
        "After “has”, “hasn’t”, “haven’t”, “had”, and “hadn’t”, you should only use past participles, and not past tense forms or the basic forms (infinitive)",
        "That is, you should say — + • I have/haven’t forgotten it. • I had/hadn’t done it.",
        "You shouldn’t say — + • I have/haven’t forgot it. • I had/hadn’t did it.",
        "All right, let's practise the right combinations!",
        "Say unit ALOUD. Several times"
