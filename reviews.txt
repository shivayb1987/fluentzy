The book is the result of about 300 interviews and involves the early investors and developers of Bitcoin.

The books starts off with Satoshi Nakamoto publishing his white paper (pdf initially) in cypherphunks group. There would be not much interest for first few days. Then Han Finney requests for some software to see the principles in action and effectively lays the first stone.

Bitcoin is the product of many collaborations and many interpretations. Without the people like Han Finney, Gavin Andresen, Roger Ver, Erik Voohres, Wences Casares, Charlie Shrem, Jed McCaleb, Ross Ulbricht, and others, Bitcoin wouldn't be what it is today.

This book is about these people who added bones and flesh into Bitcoin.

To read this book is to fall in love with Bitcoin and the people who trusted and took the jump. It's really a tribute. God bless Satoshi Nakamoto! Nathaniel Popper too!
