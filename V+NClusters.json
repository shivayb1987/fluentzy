        "Words have a tendency to combine together habitually and form collocations. There are six types of collocations.",
        "Of these six types of collocations, “Verb-Noun” collocations are the most frequently occurring ones.",
        "Here’s a very useful collection of these collocations – “Verb-Noun” collocations – for intensive oral practice. + Get a lot of practice saying them aloud!"
