        "People who aren’t fluent try to speak in ‘words’, by trying to put individual words together.",
        "But, the right way to speak English is to speak it in “word groups”, by putting word groups together.",
        "This is because the real units of speech are ‘ideas’.",
        "Get your organs of speech and hearing to become familiar with the way questions are framed.",
        "And ideas normally get expressed in groups of words, rather than in individual words.",
