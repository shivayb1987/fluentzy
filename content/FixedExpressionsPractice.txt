• He’s absolutely honest and [above suspicion]. • Occasionally, I do
get up by five — but not [as a rule]. • [At a glance], he could see it
was not the real thing. • At a guess, there were 200 people at the
meeting. • He didn’t know what to do — he was [at a loose end].
• It was all so sudden that I couldn’t say anything — I was [at a
loss]. • You can sell the car [at a profit]. • I can’t do more than one
thing [at a time]. • There’s no alternative — you have to finish it
by tomorrow [at all costs]. • I met her at breakfast, not [at lunch]. •
I’m never [at ease] in his presence — he makes me uncomfortable.
• He seemed to be very soft [at first sight] — but soon we found
that he was very tough. • There was a big stone lying [at hand],
and she hit him with it. • Here she is [at last] — what a long time
she has been! • Why didn’t you go? [At least], you could have sent
a telegram. • He didn’t look carefully — he just picked up one
[at random]. • Is he doing well [at school]? • You’ll have to get this
done somehow — our reputation is [at stake]. • It must reach here
by the 30th [at the latest]. • Greece and Turkey were [at war] then.
• Those things must have happened [before my time]. • Read
the newspaper everyday — or you’ll be [behind the times]. • I met
him quite [by accident]. • Why do you doubt? I’ll be there [by all
means]. • He discovered what was happening [by chance]. • When
you say the same thing over and over again, you learn to say it
[by heart]. • She is related to them [by marriage]. • I picked it up
[by mistake] — I thought it was mine. • There are fifty of them,
and he knows everyone of them [by name]. • I don’t know them by
name, but I know them [by sight]. • All these developments took
me [by surprise], and I was at a loss.
• Today, we’ll have something else [for a change]. • I have not
decided when to go back — I’ll be here [for a while]. • I hadn’t seen
him for ages — today, I met him [by chance]. • He’ll not be coming
back — he has left the place [for good]. • I’m not doing this for
anything — I’m doing this [for love]. • Don’t be so obstinate — you
must do it [for my sake]. • You’ll have to pay for it — you can’t have
it [for nothing]. • I wish he treated us all to lunch [for once]. • We
call it ‘fridge’ [for short] — actually, it’s full name is ‘refrigerator’.
• I don’t know [for sure] — but [at a guess], he must have paid not
less than 2000 rupees. • They’ve lost everything they had — now
they’ll have to start [from scratch]. • He comes here asking for this
and that [from time to time]. • He and his wife were walking [hand
in hand]. • You don’t have to worry — your children can play
here [in (complete) safety]. • I don’t agree with you completely,
but [in a way] you are right. • You don’t have to pay anything [in
advance]. • There’s no difference of opinion now — they’re all [in
agreement]. • All your jokes are [in bad] taste — stop making them.
• You speak to him — he is [in charge]. • Who’s [in command] here
—you or your wife? • No wonder you like her — you two have
got much [in common]. • Don’t quote me — she told it to me [in
confidence]. • You can go ahead with it — we’re all [in favour]. •
Fire broke out half an hour back — everything is [in flames] now.
• Her place has become so colourful — all the plants and trees
are [in flower]. • I was a bit late, and when I reached there, the
celebrations were [in full swing]. • That’s a very good school — he’s
[in good hands]. • We got there [in good] time, and there was plenty
of time left. • That’s 100 feet [in height]. • There’s a reception [in
his honour] — he has been elected. • Why are they all wearing
black? Are they [in mourning]? • Don’t stand [in my light] — I can’t
see to read. • What would you have done if you had been [in my
shoes]? • Get everything ready — they’ll get here [in no time] at all.
• Don’t leave the books lying scattered like this — keep them all
[in order]. • He has sprained his elbow — he is [in pain]. • It’s no use
writing — explain it to them [in person]. • It’s all very well for us to
say — but will it work [in practice]? • I agree [in principle], but I’m
not sure whether it’ll work [in practice]. • I’ll do it for you — but
what do I get [in return]? • They sacked him, and he is now doing
all these [in revenge]. • There aren’t any oranges now — they are
not [in season]. • I had nothing against him, but I had to hit him
[in self-defence]. • It’s not entirely bad — it’s good [in some respects].
• How much of this do you have [in stock]? • This week is not
going to be pleasant — there’s plenty of trouble [in store]. • It was
all right [in the beginning], but it became boring [in the end]. • You
should’ve told me everything — instead, you kept me [in the dark].
• I had to search for a long time — but I found it [in the end]. •
There may not be any immediate benefit — but it will bring you
profits [in the long run].

• I can’t get started — I’m not [in the mood]. • He has been in the
news for sometime now. • He likes swimming [in the nude] — with
absolutely nothing on. • About this, you are not [in the right] —
you are certainly wrong. • I have the same problem — we’re [in
the same boat]. • Go and play outside — you are always getting
[in the way]. • He warned me [in time]. • I was afraid the bus would
be late — but we got there [in time]. • I don’t know his address —

very costly. • I don’t want it — it’s [of no use]. • He is a bit [off
colour] — maybe, he has a headache or something. • I don’t know
what happened — I was [off duty] then. • I’ll have to look it up — I
can’t tell you [off hand]. • I told her everything — I wanted to get
it [off my chest]. • That’s impossible — you must be [off your head]. •

• She has gone [on a journey] to Dubai. • I met him in Bombay — I
was there [on a visit]. • We are here [on business] — not [on holiday].

going. • I didn’t get the bus — I came [on foot]. • Let us go on
foot — the scooter is out of order. • He missed several balls — he
wasn’t [on form], I think. • Who said we had quarrelled? We’re on
good terms. • He got a VCR [on hire] for a few days. • He’s very
thoughtful — there’s something [on his mind], I believe. • They
kept on announcing the results (every hour) [on the hour]. • Was
he [on duty] on that day or was he [on leave]? • It’s not mine — I’ve
got it [on loan]. • This (book) is not mine — it’s [on loan] from a
friend. • I can’t come — my assistant will be there [on my behalf].
• Your intentions may be good, but I am against the scheme,
and I object to it [on principle]. • She didn’t do it [on purpose] — it
happened [by accident]. • I was about to send in my resignation —
but [on second thoughts], I decided not to. • There has been some
delay — the employees were [on strike]. • Don’t worry — we’ve
got whatever he said [on tape]. • Incidents like this are [on the
increase] nowadays. • We heard it [on the radio]. • He asked for an
advance of 5000 rupees, and I gave it to him [on the spot]. • Most
of the trains arrive [on time]. • I saw it [on TV]. • Try the keys [one by
one] — one of them will fit. • He came running — he was [out of
breath]. • His feelings got [out of control]. • He is still unconscious,
but he is [out of danger]. • They have lost once again — they are
[out of luck]. • Our washing machine has been [out of order] for two

not been selected — he has been [out of practice] for sometime
now. • He is now [out of reach] of the police — he is in Brazil. • He

— the news came [out of the blue]. • You won’t get it back — that’s
[out of the question]. • He has been [out of work] since July last — he
has had an accident.
• [To my knowledge], nothing of that sort has happened.
• We can’t admit him — he’s [under age]. • They haven’t

give them a free hand in everything — keep them [under control].
